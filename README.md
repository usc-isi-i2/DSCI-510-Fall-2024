# DSCI-510-Fall-2024 - Getting Started


This document explains the things required to get started with programming in python.


## Create a Github account

All students should have a github account, use [this](https://github.com/signup) link to sign up for a new account in case you do not have one.

## Conda: Installation and Virtual Environment setup

[For Windows](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)

[For Mac](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html)

[For Linux](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)

NOTE: **The following commands are run in a terminal.**

### Creating a virtual environment
Students should create a virtual environment for each assignment, and project in general. This is a good python programming practice. For example, to create a virtual environment for lab assignemnt 1,

```
conda create -n dsci-510 python=3.10 -y
```
Creates a conda virtual environment called `dsci-510` and the major python version is `3.10`

### Activate the conda environment
```
conda activate dsci-510
```

You should see something similar to this ,
```
D22ML-AMANDEEP:~ amandeep$ conda activate dsci-510
(dsci-510) D22ML-AMANDEEP:~ amandeep$
```

The (dsci-510) means that the conda environment: `dsci-510` is active.

### Check python version
```
python --version
```

Output should be similar to this ,

```
(dsci-510) D22ML-AMANDEEP:~ amandeep$ python --version
Python 3.10.12
```

### Start Python Shell
Typing the following command in the terminal starts the interactive python shell
```
python
```

The output of the above command should be similar to this ,

```
(dsci-510) D22ML-AMANDEEP:~ amandeep$ python
Python 3.10.12 (main, Jul  5 2023, 15:02:25) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Now we are ready to write some code
```
(dsci-510) D22ML-AMANDEEP:~ amandeep$ python
Python 3.10.12 (main, Jul  5 2023, 15:02:25) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = 1
>>> y = x + 5
>>> x
1
>>> y
6
>>> y += 10
>>> y
16
>>>
```

Press `Enter` to execute a line in the python shell.

## IDE Recommendation

Students can download a one year free license for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) with USC email id. I use `PyCharm` myself in my projects.
You do not have to use `PyCharm`, any text editor would work.

## Installing Jupyter Lab

Jupyter lab provides a web based interactive development environment. Install jupyter lab by running this command, in the terminal ,

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You will have to register your conda environment with Jupyter before it can be used in the jupyter notebooks. If the conda environment
is called `dsci-510`,  run the following command to register this conda environment with Jupter ,

```
python -m ipykernel install --name dsci-510 --display-name dsci-510
```

Finally, run jupyter lab by typing the following command ,

```
jupyter lab
```

You should see output similar to this ,

Please note that updating to Notebook 7 might break some of your extensions.
